#Bavarian Helles lager
##3-gallon batch

This is an all-grain recipe for Bavarian-style Helles from Northern Brewer that I scaled down for a 3-gallon batch.  
You can read my blog post on brewing this here: http://carboy.tommeagher.com/entries/next-stop-bavaria.html

###Yeast preparation
Begin by preparing [a yeast starter](http://www.northernbrewer.com/documentation/YeastStarter.pdf). Use 0.6 of a package of _Wyeast Labs 2308 Munich Lager_ yeast.

The idea is get the yeast cells riled up before unleashing them into the cold lager wort. Make a half-cup of DME in 650 ml of boiling water. Then toss the starter flask into an ice bath to cool the wort to a good pitching temperature. After pitching, leave the yeast for about 24 hours in the flask at room temperature.

###Mash
The next day, brew this 3-gallon batch of Helles:

Start by bringing 9.22 qt ( 1.50 qt/lb ) water to 133.4°F

Add your milled grains.
* 5.70 lbs Pilsner (2 Row) Ger
* 0.45 lbs Cara-Pils/Dextrine

Protein Rest, 20 min @ 122.0°F<br />
Beta Sacch' Rest, 30 min @ 149.0°F<br />
Alpha Sacch' Rest, 30 min @ 158.0°F<br />
Mashout, 10 min @ 170.0°F<br />
Sparge 10.96 qt ( 2.00 qt/lb ) of 170.0°F water over 60 mins

###Boil
Then your boil. Add these hops at the appropriate times.

* 0.60 ozs Hallertauer (17.79 IBU), 60 mins  
* 0.60 ozs Hallertauer Hersbrucker (7.36 IBU), 15 mins  

Once the wort is chilled and in the primary fermenter, pitch the yeast that got a one-day head start. This should help keep it moving as the temperatures drop in the lagering fridge.

###Fermentation
After two weeks at about 52 degrees, it'll be ready to move to the secondary fermenter and the cold lagering phase.

Primary,	14 days @ 52.0°F<br />
Diacetyl rest,	2 days @ 63.0°F<br />
Secondary,	28 days @ 44.0°F<br />
Bottle/Keg,	14 days @ 74.0°F<br />
