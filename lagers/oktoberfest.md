#Oktoberfest Märzen
##3-gallon batch

This is an all-grain recipe for a Bavarian-style Oktoberfest from Northern Brewer that I scaled down for a 3-gallon batch.  

###Yeast preparation
Begin by preparing [a yeast starter](http://www.northernbrewer.com/documentation/YeastStarter.pdf). Use 0.6 of a package of _[Wyeast Labs 2633 Oktoberfest](http://www.wyeastlab.com/rw_yeaststrain_detail.cfm?ID=134)_ yeast.

The idea is get the yeast cells riled up before unleashing them into the cold lager wort. Make a 3/4-cup of DME in 650 ml of boiling water for about 15 minutes. Then toss the starter flask into an ice bath to cool the wort to a good pitching temperature. After pitching, leave the yeast for about 24 hours in the flask at room temperature.

###Mash
The next day, brew this 3-gallon batch of Oktoberfest:

Start by bringing 10.35 qt of strike water to 133.4°F

Add your milled grains.
* 3 lbs Munich (2 Row) Pilsner
* 3 lbs Munich Malt
* 0.6 lbs Dark Munich Malt
* 0.3 lbs Weyermann Caramunich II

Protein Rest, 20 min @ 122.0°F<br />
Beta Sacch' Rest, 30 min @ 149.0°F<br />
Alpha Sacch' Rest, 30 min @ 158.0°F<br />
Mashout, 10 min @ 170.0°F<br />
Sparge, 3.45 gallons of 170.0°F water over 60 mins

###Boil
Then your boil. Add these hops at the appropriate times.
* 0.60 ozs of Hallertauer Mittelfruh pellets, 60 mins  

Once the wort is chilled and in the primary fermenter, pitch the yeast that got a one-day head start. This should help keep it moving as the temperatures drop in the lagering fridge.

###Fermentation
After two weeks at about 52 degrees, it'll be ready to move to the secondary fermenter and the cold lagering phase.

Primary,	14 days @ 52.0°F<br />
Diacetyl rest,	2 days @ 63.0°F<br />
Secondary,	45 days @ 44.0°F<br />
Bottle/Keg,	14 days @ 74.0°F<br />
