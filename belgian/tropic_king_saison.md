#Funkwerks Tropic King Saison
##3-gallon batch

This is an all-grain recipe, modified from the one shared by Funkwerks' brewmaster in issue #2 of [Craft Beer & Brewing](http://www.beerandbrewing.com/) magazine and scaled down to 3 gallons. Because it's a saison that enjoys a warm yeast, this is a good one to brew in hot weather, like late spring or early summer.

For the yeast, I used the _[White Labs 0565 Belgian Saison Yeast](http://www.whitelabs.com/yeast/wlp565-belgian-saison-i-yeast?s=homebrew)_. You can also try the _[Wyeast 3711 French Saison](https://www.wyeastlab.com/rw_yeaststrain_detail.cfm?ID=199)_.

###Mash
Start by bringing 9.94 qt of strike water to 167.3°F

Add your milled grains.
* 6.07 lbs Pale Malt
* 1.27 lbs Munich Malt
* 6 oz Wheat Malt
* 3.6 oz Carapils

Sacch' Rest, 75 min @ 150°F<br />
Mashout, 10 min @ 170.0°F<br />
Sparge, 8.74 qts of 170.0°F water.

###Boil
Then your boil. Add these hops at the appropriate times. The recipe called for some hops that are mostly available to commercial breweries, so we had to make a few substitutions. Instead of Rakau, we used Summit. Instead of Opal, we used Styrian Golding.
* 0.35 ozs of Summit pellets, 60 mins  
* 0.30 oz of Summit pellets, 10 mins
* 0.4 oz of Styrian Golding pellets, 0 mins

Once the wort is chilled and in the primary fermenter, pitch the yeast.

###Fermentation
After two weeks at about 75 degrees, you're going to dry hop the beer by adding another 0.3 oz of Summit pellets into the secondary fermenter.

Primary,	14 days @ 75°F<br />
Secondary,	14-28 days @ 72°F<br />
Bottle/Keg,	14 days @ 74.0°F<br />
