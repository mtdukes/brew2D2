#Carolina Butcher Red IPA
##5-gallon batch
An apex predator of the Triassic Period, Carnufex carolinensis ruled the warm equatorial region that is now North Carolina alongside the dinosaurs. The "Carolina Butcher" was discovered in a rock quarry in Chatham County, and as one of the earliest and largest crocodylomorphs eventually evolved into today's crocodiles.

The Carolina Butcher Red IPA recalls the dominance of the 9-foot-long Carnufex with earthy, bold notes of Warrior, Challenger and Brewer's Gold hops and balances its bitter bite with a full, ruby-hued body.

Or at least, that's the idea (this is a work in progress).
