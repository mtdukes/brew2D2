#brew2D2
A collaborative collection of recipes for homebrewed beer in a variety of styles.

Inspired by [Taco Fancy](https://github.com/sinker/tacofancy), which is delicious.

##Styles so far
Some of these are just placeholders. Just think of them as places to add your beers!

* [Belgian](https://github.com/mtdukes/brew2D2/tree/master/belgian)
* [Lagers](https://github.com/mtdukes/brew2D2/tree/master/lagers)
* [Pale ales](https://github.com/mtdukes/brew2D2/tree/master/pale_ales)
* Porters
* Witbiers

##To do
[ ] Standardized recipe style maybe
[ ] Maybe something cool on the front end like the [MinnPost CAR code page](http://code.minnpost.com/car-code/)
