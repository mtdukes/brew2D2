#Bavarian Helles lager
##3-gallon batch

This is an all-grain recipe for Bavarian-style Helles from Northern Brewer that I scaled down for a 3-gallon batch.  
You can read my blog post on brewing this here: http://carboy.tommeagher.com/entries/next-stop-bavaria.html

###Yeast preparation
Begin by preparing [a yeast starter](http://www.northernbrewer.com/documentation/YeastStarter.pdf). Use 0.6 of a package of _Wyeast Labs 2308 Munich Lager_ yeast.

The idea is get the yeast cells riled up before unleashing them into the cold lager wort. Make a half-cup of DME in 650 ml of boiling water. Then toss the starter flask into an ice bath to cool the wort to a good pitching temperature. After pitching, leave the yeast for about 24 hours in the flask at room temperature.

###Mash
The next day, brew this 3-gallon batch of Helles:
Start by bringing 9.22 qt ( 1.50 qt/lb ) water to 133.4°F

Add your milled grains.
5.70 lbs Pilsner (2 Row) Ger
0.45 lbs Cara-Pils/Dextrine

Protein Rest    20 min @ 122.0°F
Beta Sacch' Rest        30 min @ 149.0°F
Alpha Sacch' Rest       30 min @ 158.0°F
Mashout 10 min @ 170.0°F
Sparge 10.96 qt ( 2.00 qt/lb ) of 170.0°F water over 60 mins

###Boil
Then your boil. Add these hops at the appropriate times.
Amount  IBU's    Name   Time
0.60 ozs 17.79   Hallertauer    60 mins  
0.60 ozs 7.36    Hallertauer Hersbrucker        15 mins  

Once the wort is chilled and in the primary fermenter, pitched the yeast that got a one-day head start. This should help keep it moving as the temperatures drop in the lagering fridge.

###Fermentation
After two weeks at about 52 degrees, it'll be ready to move to the secondary fermenter and the cold lagering phase.

Primary	14 days @ 52.0°F
