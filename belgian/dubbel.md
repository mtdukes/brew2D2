#Belgian Dubbel
##3-gallon batch

This is an all-grain recipe for Belgian-style dubbel from Northern Brewer that I scaled down for a 3-gallon batch.

###Mash
Start by bringing 9.68 qt ( 1.50 qt/lb ) water to 166.3°F

Add your milled grains.

* 6.00 lbs, Pale Malt (2 Row) Bel
* 0.30 lbs, Caramunich Malt
* 0.15 lbs, Special B Malt

Sacch' Rest,	60 min @ 151.0°F<br />
Heat to 170.0°F over 2 mins<br />
Mashout, 10 min @ 170.0°F<br />
Sparge 12.90 qt ( 2.00 qt/lb ) of 170.0°F water over 60 mins

###Boil
Then your boil. Add these hops and additions at the appropriate times.

* 0.60 ozs Tradition (20.75 IBU), 60 mins
* 0.60 lbs Candi Sugar Dark,	15 mins
* 0.60 ozs Hallertauer Hersbrucker (5.02 IBU), 10 mins

Once the wort is cooled and in the primary fermenter, pitch 0.6 of a package of the _Wyeast Labs 1214 Belgian Ale_ yeast.

###Fermentation
Follow the advice on the yeast package, but the Belgian Ale yeast likes to be warm. Keep in the primary fermenter no more than two weeks, then rack to the secondary for another three weeks or more before bottling/kegging.
